* Program Change

Chordcat comes with 128 default instruments (a.k.a programs) as
prescribed in the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_MIDI][General MIDI spec]].

You can also play all 16 MIDI channels simultaneously with 16 MIDI
devices. You can bind any instrument to any channel.

To bind an instrument to a channel, say you want to bind the electric
bass to the default channel, channel 0.

You can go to ~Preferences~ -> ~Piano~ -> ~Program Change~ and bind
instrument ~33~ to channel 0 like so:

The instrument numbers are from the General MIDI spec. You can view
all the instruments and their codes by clicking on ~Show Instrument
Table~ in the app.

Here is the instrument table for your reference:

* Loading Soundfonts

If you want to use a different soundfont to the default one, you can
download any ~.sf2~ soundfont (extension must be lowercase) and paste
it in the soundfonts folder.

The soundfont folder is different depending on your OS.

+ Linux and MacOS : ~$XDG_DATA_DIR/chordcat/soundfonts~ which is ~~/.local/share/chordcat/soundfonts/~ on most systems.
+ Linux Flatpak: ~~/.var/app/dev.ters.Chordcat/data/chordcat/soundfonts/~
+ Michaelsoft Binbows :  ~%AppData%\chordcat\soundfonts\~

Once you have pasted your soundfonts, restart chordcat. You can then
select your soundfont in ~Preferences~ -> ~Configuration~ ->
~Soundfont~.

When a new soundfont is loaded, the corresponding instrument out of
the 128 default instruments, is replaced with the new soundfont. The
remaining instruments are unchanged.
