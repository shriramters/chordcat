* Windows

** Installation

Download the file named ~chordcat-0.1.0-win64.exe~ from the [[https://github.com/shriramters/chordcat/releases/tag/v0.1.0][releases page]].

You may be greeted with the Windows Defender SmartScreen warning. This
is because I haven't codesigned the installer binary with a microsoft
certificate (because it costs a few hundred dollars /year).

If you trust the app, you can click "More Info" and select "Run Anyway".

Once you are in the installer, you can click next to everything as the
defaults are pretty sensible.

Keep in mind, the "Create Desktop Icon" functionality doesn't work as of now.

Once the app is installed, you can find the app by searching for "Chordcat"
in the Start Menu.

** Uninstall

You can uninstall chordcat directly from the Start Menu entry or from the
control panel (search for "Add or Remove Programs" in the start menu).

* Debian
Download the file named ~chordcat_0.1.0_amd64.deb~ from the [[https://github.com/shriramters/chordcat/releases/tag/v0.1.0][releases page]].

If you use GNOME or KDE, you can double click the file to install it.

You can also install it from the command line like so:
#+begin_example bash
cd ~/Downloads
sudo apt install ./chordcat_0.1.0_amd64.deb
#+end_example

If you are unable to double click it, you can install the graphical installer
~gdebi~ and try again

#+begin_example bash
sudo apt install gdebi
#+end_example

Find it in your app launcher afterwards:

You might have to use the terminal for this:
#+begin_example bash
sudo apt remove --autoremove chordcat
#+end_example
