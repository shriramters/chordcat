There are three ways of playing notes on Chordcat.

- Using PC Keyboard
- Clicking the piano keys with a mouse
- Using a Midi Device


* Using PC Keyboard

You can use your regular keyboard to play the piano on chordcat.

Keybindings are similar to [[https://vmpk.sourceforge.io/][VMPK]]

i.e; ~QWERTYUIO~ will play the notes ~CDEFGABC~. The key above ~Q~ and ~W~ on the PC keyboard (num 2) will play the black key between ~C~ and ~D~ which is ~C#~.

Similarly, you can use ~ZXCVBNM~ to play the notes which are an octave below, just like VMPK.

Additionally, You can use the ~+~ and ~-~ keys to shift the current octave up and down respectively.

* Using Mouse

You can use the mouse to click the piano keys on the screen to toggle notes. These notes stay pressed until you toggle them again.

You can also use the ~Clear All~ button on the top left of the screen to toggle all notes off.

* Using a MIDI Device

Connect any number of MIDI devices and close and re-open chordcat. The MIDI device should appear in the device selector at

~Preferences~ -> ~Configuration~ -> ~MIDI Device~
